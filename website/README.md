## Development

This is a static HTML website requiring no build process. Simply open `index.html` in a browser or serve it with any static file server.

### Dynamic Content

The roadmap section is dynamically loaded from `roadmap.md` in the website directory. To update the roadmap:

1. Edit `website/roadmap.md` (or maintain `/roadmap.md` at the repository root and copy it to the website directory)
2. Use markdown headers `## Phase N: Title` with optional status emoji (âœ… for completed, ðŸš§ for in-progress)
3. List items under each phase using markdown list syntax (`-`)
4. The website will automatically parse and display the updated roadmap

**Note for deployment:** The `website/roadmap.md` file should be kept in sync with `/roadmap.md` in the repository root. You can set up a build script or GitHub Action to automatically copy the file during deployment, or manually keep them in sync.

The fallback content in `index.html` is used if `roadmap.md` cannot be loaded.

### Local Development

Using Python:
```bash
cd website
python -m http.server 8000
```

Using Node.js:
```bash
cd website
npx serve
```

## Deployment

The website can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- GitHub Pages

# Session View/Edit Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds complete view/edit functionality for Sessions with DM-only info, shared logs, and public read-only sharing via tokens.

  - Added `updatedAt` and `rev` for consistency
  - Requires build_runner regeneration

- **Modified**: `moonforge/lib/data/drift/tables/sessions.dart`
  - Added all new fields to Drift Sessions table
  - Added field comments for clarity
  - Requires build_runner regeneration

- **Modified**: `moonforge/lib/data/drift/dao/sessions_dao.dart`

### Utilities
- **Created**: `moonforge/lib/core/utils/permissions_utils.dart`
  - `isDM()`: Checks if user is campaign owner
  - `isPlayer()`: Checks if user is campaign member
  - `hasAccess()`: Checks if user has any access

- **Created**: `moonforge/lib/core/utils/share_token_utils.dart`
  - `generateToken()`: Creates cryptographically secure 32-byte tokens
  - `isTokenValid()`: Validates token enabled status and expiration

### Widgets
- **Created**: `moonforge/lib/core/widgets/share_settings_dialog.dart`
  - Dialog for managing share settings
  - Enable/disable sharing
  - Copy share link to clipboard
  - Warning about public access

### Screens
- **Modified**: `moonforge/lib/features/session/views/session_screen.dart`
  - Full implementation replacing placeholder
  - Shows DM-only info section (with permission check)
  - Shows shared log section (all users)
  - Edit button (DM-only)
  - Share settings button (DM-only)
  - Read-only Quill viewers

- **Modified**: `moonforge/lib/features/session/views/session_edit_screen.dart`
  - Full implementation replacing placeholder
  - DM-only access enforcement
  - Two separate Quill editors (info and log)
  - Autosave for both editors
  - Save to Firestore with proper rev handling

- **Created**: `moonforge/lib/features/session/views/session_public_share_screen.dart`
  - Standalone screen accessible without authentication
  - Token-based lookup
  - Shows only log (never info)
  - Validates token enabled status and expiration

### Router
- **Modified**: `moonforge/lib/core/services/app_router.dart`
  - Added import for SessionPublicShareScreen
  - Added `SessionPublicShareRoute` class
  - Route: `/share/session/:token`
  - Outside app shell (no auth required)
  - Requires build_runner regeneration

### Localization
- **Modified**: `moonforge/lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
  - Added "shareSettings" and "close" strings

## Security Features

### DM-Only Info Protection
1. **View Screen**: Only displays info section if `PermissionsUtils.isDM()` returns true
2. **Edit Screen**: Checks DM status, shows "Only the DM can edit sessions" error if not DM
3. **Public Share**: Never includes info field, only log field
4. **Database**: Relies on Firestore security rules (not included in this PR)

### Token Security
1. **Generation**: Uses `Random.secure()` with 32 bytes (256 bits of entropy)
2. **Encoding**: Base64 URL-safe encoding, stripped of padding
3. **Validation**: Checks both `shareEnabled` flag and optional `shareExpiresAt`
4. **Revocation**: DM can disable by setting `shareEnabled = false`

### XSS Protection
- Relies on Quill's built-in sanitization
- Stores Quill Delta JSON (not raw HTML)
- Quill viewer renders safely

## Architecture Patterns

### Consistent with Codebase
- Uses `SurfaceContainer` for layout (as per guidelines)
- Uses `CustomQuillViewer` and `CustomQuillEditor` from existing infrastructure
- Uses `QuillAutosave` utility for draft persistence
- Uses `ButtonM3E` from m3e_collection package
- Uses `toastification` for notifications
- Uses `logger` for error logging
- Follows existing patterns from `adventure_screen.dart` and `adventure_edit_screen.dart`

### State Management
- Uses `Provider` for auth and campaign state
- Uses `FutureBuilder` for async data loading
- Uses `StatefulWidget` for local state (controllers, loading flags)

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around database operations
- User-friendly error messages via toastification
- Logs detailed errors for debugging
- Graceful degradation (empty states, back buttons)

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Performance
**Current**: Public share screen iterates through all campaigns/parties/sessions to find token
**Impact**: O(n) lookup, could be slow with many sessions
**Recommended Fix**: Create separate Firestore collection to index tokens for O(1) lookup
**Code Comment**: Already noted in `session_public_share_screen.dart` lines 42-44

### Firestore Security Rules (Not Included)
The following rules should be added to firebase/firestore.rules:

```javascript
// Sessions within parties
match /campaigns/{campaignId}/parties/{partyId}/sessions/{sessionId} {
  // DMs can read/write all fields
  allow read, write: if isOwner(campaignId);
  
  // Members can read log and other fields (but not info)
  allow read: if isMember(campaignId);
  
  // Public share access (no auth required)
  // Note: This is read-only and should validate token on server
  allow read: if resource.data.shareEnabled == true && 
                  (resource.data.shareExpiresAt == null || 
                   resource.data.shareExpiresAt > request.time);
}
```

### Mention Links in Public View
Currently, the public share screen passes `null` for `onMentionTap` callback, disabling mention links. This is intentional for security (no deep links into authenticated areas), but could be enhanced to:
- Show entity names without links
- Link to public entity pages (if those existed)

### Share Analytics
No analytics/tracking of share link usage. Could add:
- View count
- Last accessed timestamp
- IP rate limiting (requires backend)

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **DM Permissions**
   - [ ] DM can view info and log sections
   - [ ] DM can edit both info and log
   - [ ] DM can enable/disable sharing
   - [ ] DM can copy share link

2. **Player Permissions**
   - [ ] Player can view log section
   - [ ] Player cannot view info section
   - [ ] Player cannot edit session
   - [ ] Player has no share button

3. **Public Share**
   - [ ] Unauthenticated user can access /share/session/:token
   - [ ] Only log is visible (not info)
   - [ ] Invalid token shows "not found" message
   - [ ] Expired token shows "expired" message
   - [ ] Disabled share shows "revoked" message

4. **Functionality**
   - [ ] Autosave works for both editors
   - [ ] Save button persists changes
   - [ ] Quill toolbar works correctly
   - [ ] Copy to clipboard works
   - [ ] Token generation creates unique tokens

### Unit Tests (To Be Added)
- `permissions_utils_test.dart`: Test isDM, isPlayer, hasAccess
- `share_token_utils_test.dart`: Test generateToken uniqueness, isTokenValid logic
- Widget tests for ShareSettingsDialog
- Integration tests for session CRUD operations

### Security Tests (To Be Added)
- Verify info field is never in public API responses
- Verify tokens are cryptographically secure (entropy test)
- Verify expired tokens are rejected
- Verify disabled shares are rejected

## Breaking Changes
None. This is a new feature implementation for previously placeholder screens.

## Migration Required
After build_runner regenerates files, any existing sessions in Firestore will automatically have:
- `shareEnabled: false` (default)
- `shareToken: null` (default)
- Other new fields will be null/default

No data migration script needed due to Firestore's flexible schema.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses existing packages:
- flutter_quill (already present)
- m3e_collection (already present)
- toastification (already present)
- firestore_odm (already present)

## Compliance with Project Guidelines
✅ Uses existing widgets (SurfaceContainer, CustomQuill*)
✅ Uses existing utilities (logger, datetime_utils)
✅ Follows Material 3 Expressive design language
✅ Uses m3e_collection buttons
✅ Internationalization ready (uses AppLocalizations)
✅ Uses firestore_odm as specified
✅ Minimal changes (only modified necessary files)
✅ One file per class (mostly, except route classes in app_router)
✅ Small, focused widgets
✅ Business logic separated from UI where practical

## Code Review Focus Areas

1. **Security**: Verify info field is never exposed in public contexts
2. **Permissions**: Verify DM checks are correct and consistent
3. **Token Generation**: Verify cryptographic security of token generation
4. **Error Handling**: Verify all edge cases are handled gracefully
5. **Performance**: Acknowledge O(n) token lookup limitation (documented)
6. **Consistency**: Verify patterns match existing screens (adventure, scene)
7. **Null Safety**: Verify proper null handling throughout
8. **Accessibility**: Verify proper labels and semantics (not explicitly added yet)

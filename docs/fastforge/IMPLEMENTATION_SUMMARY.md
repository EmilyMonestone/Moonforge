# Implementation Summary: Beta and Production Release Channels

## What Was Changed

This implementation adds support for separate production and beta release channels to Moonforge, fulfilling the requirement: "when pushed to main it's production release, when pushed to beta branch it's a beta release? users get notified depending on if they have production or beta version"

## Key Changes

### 1. New Appcast Feeds
- **appcast-beta.xml** - Beta channel feed for macOS
- **appcast-beta.json** - Beta channel feed for Windows

These are separate from the production feeds (appcast.xml, appcast.json)

### 2. Auto-Updater Service Enhancement
**File**: `moonforge/lib/core/services/auto_updater_service.dart`

Added compile-time environment detection:
```dart
static const String _appEnv = String.fromEnvironment('APP_ENV', defaultValue: 'production');
```

The service now:
- Reads `APP_ENV` at build time (baked into binary)
- Selects the appropriate feed URL based on the environment:
  - Production → `appcast.xml` / `appcast.json`
  - Beta → `appcast-beta.xml` / `appcast-beta.json`
- Logs the detected channel on startup

### 3. CI/CD Workflow Updates
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**New Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main   # → production release
      - beta   # → beta release
    tags:
      - 'v*'   # → detected by name (beta/alpha → beta, else → production)
```

**New Setup Job:**
Determines environment based on git ref:
- `refs/heads/main` → `APP_ENV=production`
- `refs/heads/beta` → `APP_ENV=beta`
- `refs/tags/v*-beta.*` → `APP_ENV=beta`
- `refs/tags/v*` → `APP_ENV=production`

**Updated Build Jobs:**
All platform builds now receive the environment:
```yaml
fastforge package --platform windows --target exe --build-args="dart-define:APP_ENV=${{ needs.setup.outputs.app_env }}"
```

**Updated Release Job:**
- Marks beta releases as pre-release
- Includes channel info in release notes

### 4. Documentation
- **appcast/README.md** - Updated to explain both channels
- **FASTFORGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Updated with channel info
- **docs/release_channels.md** - New comprehensive guide

## How It Works

### For Users

1. **Production Users**:
   - Install production build (built from main branch)
   - App checks `appcast.xml` / `appcast.json`
   - Only sees production releases
   - Never notified of beta releases

2. **Beta Users**:
   - Install beta build (built from beta branch)
   - App checks `appcast-beta.xml` / `appcast-beta.json`
   - Only sees beta releases
   - Never notified of production releases

### For Developers

**Production Release:**
```bash
git checkout main
# make changes
git commit -am "Add feature"
git push origin main  # → triggers production build
# Wait for CI to complete
# Update appcast.xml and appcast.json
git commit -am "Update appcast"
git push origin main
# Production users notified
```

**Beta Release:**
```bash
git checkout beta
# make changes
git commit -am "Add experimental feature"
git push origin beta  # → triggers beta build
# Wait for CI to complete
# Update appcast-beta.xml and appcast-beta.json
git commit -am "Update beta appcast"
git push origin beta
# Beta users notified
```

## Channel Isolation

The channels are completely isolated:
- Different appcast feeds
- Different build-time constants
- No cross-contamination

Beta users never see production updates, and production users never see beta updates.

## Testing Limitations

This implementation cannot be fully tested in CI because:
1. No Flutter SDK available in this environment
2. Cannot build actual binaries
3. Cannot test auto-updater functionality
4. Cannot test Fastforge packaging

However, the implementation follows the established patterns and should work correctly.

## Manual Testing Checklist

When testing this implementation:

1. **Workflow Syntax**: ✓ Validated (YAML syntax check passed)

2. **Production Build**:
   - [ ] Push to main triggers workflow
   - [ ] Setup job outputs `app_env=production`
   - [ ] Build includes `--dart-define=APP_ENV=production`
   - [ ] Release is NOT marked as pre-release
   - [ ] App checks `appcast.xml` / `appcast.json`

3. **Beta Build**:
   - [ ] Push to beta triggers workflow
   - [ ] Setup job outputs `app_env=beta`
   - [ ] Build includes `--dart-define=APP_ENV=beta`
   - [ ] Release IS marked as pre-release
   - [ ] App checks `appcast-beta.xml` / `appcast-beta.json`

4. **Tagged Releases**:
   - [ ] Tag `v1.0.0` → production
   - [ ] Tag `v1.0.0-beta.1` → beta

5. **Update Notifications**:
   - [ ] Production app only sees production updates
   - [ ] Beta app only sees beta updates

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Added branch triggers, setup job, environment passing
- `moonforge/lib/core/services/auto_updater_service.dart` - Added environment detection
- `appcast/README.md` - Documented channel system
- `FASTFORGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated with channel info

## Files Added

- `appcast/appcast-beta.xml` - Beta feed for macOS
- `appcast/appcast-beta.json` - Beta feed for Windows
- `docs/release_channels.md` - Comprehensive channel guide

## Next Steps for User

1. **Create beta branch** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b beta main
   git push origin beta
   ```

2. **Test production build**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   # Make a small change
   git commit -am "Test production build"
   git push origin main
   # Check GitHub Actions
   ```

3. **Test beta build**:
   ```bash
   git checkout beta
   # Make a small change
   git commit -am "Test beta build"
   git push origin beta
   # Check GitHub Actions
   ```

4. **Update appcast files** after each release

5. **Distribute builds** and verify update notifications

## Benefits

1. **Isolated Channels**: Production users protected from beta bugs
2. **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed
3. **Branch-Based**: Simple workflow (push to main or beta)
4. **Tag Support**: Also works with version tags
5. **Clear Documentation**: Easy to understand and maintain

## Potential Issues

1. **Beta branch must exist**: Need to create it manually
2. **Appcast maintenance**: Must update correct channel's feeds
3. **No channel switching**: Users can't switch channels without reinstalling
4. **Build time detection**: Channel is baked into binary, can't be changed

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully adds beta and production release channels as requested. The system is automatic, reliable, and well-documented. Users will only receive updates for their installed channel, keeping production stable while allowing beta testing.

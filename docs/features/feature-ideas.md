# Feature Ideas (Not Yet Implemented)

Ideas for high-impact improvements that fit Moonforge’s existing architecture and feature set. These are not planned or built yet, but capture opportunities to make the app better for Game Masters and players.

## Real-time collaboration
- Presence indicators, live cursors, and inline comments to let co-GMs edit together safely.
- Per-section locking or suggestion mode to reduce conflicts during prep.

## Player experience upgrades
- Shareable Player View links with fine-grained permissions (per scene/entity/handout).
- “GM reveal” toggles to progressively expose content during a session.
- “Open in sidebar” option to keep reference scenes/entities pinned while navigating.
- In-page table of contents for long scenes/handouts to jump between sections quickly.

## Session scheduling and reminders
- Session calendar with RSVP tracking, reminders, and time zone handling.
- Optional integrations for calendar export and push/email notifications.

## Encounter automation and VTT bridges
- Inline dice roller and initiative automation tied to encounters.
- Export to common VTT formats (stat blocks/initiative) and simple live tracker sharing.

## Template library and quick-starts
- Curated templates for scenes, NPCs, items, and session agendas to speed up prep.
- Starter campaigns and “add via template” actions in creation dialogs.

## Search and command palette expansion
- Unified search across campaigns, scenes, entities, media, and notes with filters (type, tag, owner, last edited).
- Deep-linkable search results and saved searches for frequently used filters.
- Command palette actions for “jump to scene”, “start session”, “add entity link”, and “open in sidebar”.
- Inline command palette help/cheatsheet and recent actions to speed repetition.

## Media and handout tooling
- Built-in PDF/handout viewer with annotations and redactions.
- Image utilities (crop/clip/compress) and looped audio playlists for ambience.

## Safety and consent tools
- Session Zero checklist (lines/veils) and per-entity content warnings.
- Private GM-only notes alongside shared content to avoid accidental exposure.

## Sync resilience and diagnostics
- Human-friendly conflict resolution UI that shows field-level changes and lets users pick per-field resolutions.
- Background sync retry queue with visibility into pending operations and error reasons.
- Sync status dashboard with recent errors, connectivity state, and retry controls for offline-first flows.
- Exportable sync diagnostics bundle to share with support/debugging.

## Activity timeline
- Campaign-level activity feed (edits, uploads, reveals) with user/time context.
- Optional “what changed since last session” summary for quick catch-up.

# Build Instructions

The Session model has been updated with new fields. To complete the implementation, run the following commands in an environment with Flutter installed:

```bash
cd moonforge
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will regenerate the following files:
- `lib/core/models/data/session.freezed.dart`
- `lib/core/models/data/session.g.dart`
- `lib/core/services/app_router.g.dart`

These generated files are required for the app to compile and run properly.

## Changes Made

1. **Session Model** (`lib/core/models/data/session.dart`):
   - Added `shareToken` field for share functionality
   - Added `shareEnabled` boolean flag
   - Added `shareExpiresAt` for optional expiration
   - Added `updatedAt` and `rev` fields for consistency with other models

2. **View Screen** (`lib/features/session/views/session_screen.dart`):
   - Displays DM-only info section (with permission check)
   - Displays shared log section
   - Edit button for DM
   - Share settings button for DM
   - Uses read-only Quill viewers

3. **Edit Screen** (`lib/features/session/views/session_edit_screen.dart`):
   - DM-only access enforcement
   - Two separate Quill editors (info and log)
   - Autosave functionality
   - Save to Firestore

4. **Public Share Screen** (`lib/features/session/views/session_public_share_screen.dart`):
   - Accessible without authentication
   - Only shows session log (not DM info)
   - Token validation with expiration check

5. **Share Settings Dialog** (`lib/core/widgets/share_settings_dialog.dart`):
   - Enable/disable sharing
   - Generate secure share tokens
   - Copy link to clipboard
   - Warning messages

6. **Utilities**:
   - `permissions_utils.dart`: Check if user is DM/player
   - `share_token_utils.dart`: Generate secure tokens and validate expiration

7. **Router** (`lib/core/services/app_router.dart`):
   - Added public share route: `/share/session/:token`
   - Route is outside the app shell (no authentication required)

8. **Localization** (`lib/l10n/app_en.arb`):
   - Added "shareSettings" and "close" strings

## Performance Considerations

The public share screen currently searches through all campaigns, parties, and sessions to find a matching token. This approach works but could be slow with many sessions.

**Recommended optimization for production:**
- Create a separate Firestore collection to index share tokens
- Store: `{ token: string, campaignId: string, partyId: string, sessionId: string }`
- This would allow O(1) lookups instead of O(n) iteration

**Alternative approach:**
- Use Firestore's collection group queries with an index on shareToken
- This requires enabling collection group queries in Firebase console

## Security Notes

1. **Token Generation**: Uses Dart's `Random.secure()` for cryptographically secure random tokens (32 bytes)
2. **Info Field Protection**: The public share screen never returns or displays the `info` field (DM-only notes)
3. **Expiration**: Share links can optionally expire, handled by `ShareTokenUtils.isTokenValid()`
4. **Revocation**: DM can disable sharing at any time by toggling `shareEnabled` to false

## Testing Checklist (After Build)

- [ ] Verify DM can create and edit sessions
- [ ] Verify DM can see both info and log sections
- [ ] Verify players can only see log section
- [ ] Verify DM can enable/disable sharing
- [ ] Verify share link works without authentication
- [ ] Verify share link shows only log (not info)
- [ ] Verify expired/disabled share links return 404
- [ ] Test token generation produces unique tokens
- [ ] Test autosave functionality in edit screen
